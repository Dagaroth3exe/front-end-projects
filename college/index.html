            <h2><b></b>About BIT MESRA</b></h2>
            <p>Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) Mesra is a "Deemed to be University" under Sec. 3 of the U.G.C. Act 1956. The Board of Governors is responsible for the main functions and overall supervision of activities. It comprises representatives of the Ministry of Education, Government of India, the U.G.C., the State Government, The Chancellor, the AICTE, The Hindustan Charity Trust, and the Institute Faculty. Shri C.K. Birla is the Chairman of the Board of Governors while the Governor of the state of Jharkhand officiates as the Institute's Chancellor. Keeping up with the times; has never been enough at BIT as it has mostly been either at the top of ranking surveys or the first among initiators of path-breaking ideas. From the introduction of new academic programmes to re-structuring the current ones, from improving infrastructure to upgrading teaching skills, the student's welfare has always been the focal point in BIT's larger picture. As a result, the Institute enjoys an unsurpassed reputation in academia and corporate circles being the preferred manpower source for many industries not only in India but also abroad. BIT Mesra had been conceived with a vision to be recognized as a world-class learning institution for engineering and technology. But it has moved beyond the fulfillment of a scholastic promise to redefine education in the new age through creation of aptitude and comprehensive intelligence. Targets are achieved every day, only to make space for newer dreams.</p>
